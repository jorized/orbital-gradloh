## Milestone 1 (Ideation)
### Motivation
As NUS students, we all have to track our graduation process. Some uses excel sheets passed down by seniors to track,  while others simply stick to the sample study plan provided by their respective faculty departments. However, these approaches are sometimes a hassle and not very intuitive as students might be unsure of what modules they have to take in order to graduate on time. It is also not flexible enough as study plans which might differ from year to year would also mean that students will have to keep making changes and altering the plans to suit their curriculum. This is also made a problem when they are not able to follow a proper plan or see what module combinations their fellow peers are taking during each semester, and the consequences that comes along with it. As such, with these problems in mind, our team consider these experiences to be negative for NUS students and seek to offer a solution.
